Inventory manager application built in android studio

I was tasked with creating an app that someone might use. Being that I worked in retail, I figured an inventory management application would best because I have hands on experience with
those types of apps. As well as, new features, bugs, and general optimization of the app. Of course this application didn't go too far, but I have ideas that I want to add...whenever I get to them.

This app uses TWO sql databases to store all the different data it needs. There's one database for logins and one database for product storage. In the real world, both of these databases
would be moved off app and set up in a cloud server. Idealy, there would be multiple backups for both databases when blackouts occur. 

Within the app, you are allowed to do pretty much any basic manipulation for inventory you can think of. Of course it's not exactly as I wanted, but that's due to course restrictions. 
I ended up rebuilding this application twice, mainly because I didn't agree with the way they were making us develop the app. They wanted us to create all the UI first before doing any
backend work. This really threw me off because I've always developed UI and backend in parallel. The reason why it threw me off is that things change constantly. Therefore, the UI would
have to change. As a result, time is wasted on having already developed that UI...that just won't be used anymore. 

Anyway, I'm rambling on! I found this whole experience really interesting and really fun. If I could tell my highschool self this is where I'd be heading, my former self would be 
very excited.
